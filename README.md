I'm a Web Design and Development student currently working as a Full Stack Web Developer. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL. I love to learn and build something new, productive, innovative, and creative.
Right now, I'm exploring the HubSpot API and connecting it to a custom REST API I built with Node.js.

* **I'm interested in web design, digital marketing, automation, and SEO.
🌱 I’m currently learning React.js and Vue.js.
👯 I’m looking forward to collaborating on open source projects.
✔️ Ask me anything — I’m happy to help if it’s within my reach! 😉

Outside tech: 🏋️ I enjoy working out, 🎧 listening to music, 🎮 gaming, 🍻 hanging out at bars, and 🎌 watching anime.
